# LCOM-2020-2021
This repository holds my work for the 2020/2021 LCOM (Computation Laboratory) class, for the MIEIC degree @ FEUP.

It contains most exercises from the lab classes, and the final project, along with the report.

The project is an homage to the classic 1978 arcade game Space Invaders, created by 西角友宏 (Tomohiro Nishikado).

A demonstration for the project can be found at https://youtu.be/-UOf-P46CHo.

All pixel art was drawn manually (albeit quite poorly, I must admit) by me using GIMP, and I also wrote all the code (a simple version of Bresenham's line algorithm was appropriated from http://members.chello.at/~easyfilter/bresenham.html for use with the game, however).
To run this, one needs to have installed LCOM's MINIX image.

The project's documentation can be found in proj/doc, the sprites in proj/sprites, and the source code in proj/src.
